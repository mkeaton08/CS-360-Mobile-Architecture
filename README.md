# CS 360 Creating a Weight Tracking App


# What the app does and why
This app helps people track their weight. The app has the user login or create an account, enable notifications, and log/input their weight. It was made for users who want to see how their weight changes over time, like when working on fitness or health goals.

# What the app shows and how it helps users
The app has a login screen, a screen that shows weight records, and options to add, update, or delete entries. I made everything simple and clear so users can easily understand how to use it without any confusion.

# How I built the app
I built it one part at a time starting with crating the correct resource and main activity, then adding the data, then the layout, then the features. I kept the code neat and tested each part as I added it. This helped avoid problems and made the app easier to manage.

# How I tested the app
I tested everything in the Android emulator by clicking through each screen and using the features. I also used logs to see what was happening in the background. Testing helped me make sure the app worked the way users would expect.

# A challenge I faced and how I fixed it
The layout looked fine in the design view, but when I ran the app in the emulator, a banner covered some of the text. I had to test on the emulator and adjust the layout to make sure everything showed up clearly for the user. It reminded me how important it is to test what the user actually sees.

# What I did really well
I did a really good job setting up the login and password system. It worked smoothly and showed my ability to handle user input and build a secure, easy-to-use login screen. It also gave correct notifications to the user if they entered the wrong password or there was already a username found.
